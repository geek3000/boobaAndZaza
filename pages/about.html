              <b>Michel Lafon Éducation</b> is a French publishing house dedicated to the publication of school and
              extracurricular textbooks available in several

              promote
              education for all and defend civic values ​​such as respect for others. An expert in this field, Michel
              Lafon alongside
              other members in educating children across Africa as part of a global response to COVID-19 created a means
              of engaging

              <p>Our Commitment as a book publisher and content creator is to provide the best materials to learners who
                are kept away
                from school. We also see distance learning as an opportunity to reinforce and promote education to
                remote learners
                within local communities.

                Our mission for the Bouba and Zaza Educational initiative is to tackle sensitive themes such as the
                environment,
                illiteracy, HIV/AIDS to break taboos and raise children's awareness and promote gender equality and
                access to education
                for all. We are strongly convinced that education is the best way to promote equality. To promote
                capacity development
                we are also developing the Bouba and Zaza animated series in Africa, where we will train woman to work
                on developing the
                series through embarking on an animation production apprenticeship training programme. This will provide
                skills to young
                women in a tech and male dominated industry.

          <p><b>UNESCO</b> is the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. It seeks to build
            peace through international
            cooperation in Education, the Sciences and Culture. In this spirit, UNESCO develops educational tools to
            help people
            live as global citizens free of hate and intolerance. UNESCO works so that each child and citizen has access
            to quality
            education. By promoting cultural heritage and the equal dignity of all cultures, UNESCO strengthens bonds
            among nations.
            <br><br>
            UNESCO’s Regional Office in Dakar in collaboration with other partners launched “Childhood Cultures”, an
            intergenerational African series of children’s books. The collection is based on stories of the main
            characters Bouba
            and Zaza and their experiences on how they learn of their surroundings and their community. The series seeks
            to develop
            life and socialization skills outside the family context among children, parents and teachers, and is also
            part of the
            UNESCO Early childhood development (ECD) programs in Africa.
            <br><br>
            Africa has the youngest population in the world, with 130 million children (20% of the total population)
            under the age
            of 6. Out of the 49 countries worldwide where 38% of children under 5 are affected by severe or chronic
            malnutrition, 30
            are in Africa.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, as a direct outcome of HIV/AIDS, war and conflict, a large number of African children are
            either orphaned
            or refugees (there were 10.6 million orphans and 35 million refugees in 1999).
            <br><br>
            All of these factors affecting African families and their children point to the need to stress the
            importance of, and
            give priority to, early childhood care and education programs.
          <p>
            International research findings show that appropriate food, medical care and intellectual stimulation during
            the early
            years of life improve children’s aptitude and learning capability throughout their lives. Such research also
            indicates
            that the availability of books in the family environment has an incidence on children’s level of educational
            attainment
            and that children who have many books at home stay in school about three years longer than those who do not.
            <br><br>
            Based on this evidence-based research, UNESCO’s seeks to implement programs that favor and supports the
            development of
            holistic and integrated Early Childhood Development, such as the Bouba and Zaza series and is working to
            towards the
            <b>Global Education Coalition</b> initiative in delivering its COVID-19 learning recovery plan.
