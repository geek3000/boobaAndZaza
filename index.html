                    <span>The Bouba and Zaza animated series</span> follows the journey of two young characters, Bouba
                    and Zaza -
                    a boy and a girl, who learn through lively stories about caring for the environment,
                    understanding HIV and AIDS, accepting people’s differences and other themes in direct resonance
                    with contemporary society. Well beyond simply providing much needed reading materials, the
                    series encourages a dialogue with teachers, caregivers, and parents around a whole range of
                    civic issues.

                    As part of a number of initiatives set up to support a new global coalition to protect the right
                    to education during unprecedented times, the UNESCO, Michel Lafon Education and the Association
                    for the Development of Education in Africa (ADEA) are working towards the development of an
                    educational project that focuses on educating children through edutainment across Africa, as
                    part of a global response to COVID-19.

                <p>
                    The Bouba & Zaza educational series, titled <i><span>“Childhood Cultures”</span></i>, is a
                    collection of 12 story
                    books and short films, which educate children on challenging themes that are not necessarily
                    addressed within the home or part of the education curriculum across Africa.

                    As a response and approach to addressing the rising social issues in communities which are due
                    to the impact of COVID-19,
                    the project will move to the development and roll out of 12animated films based on the
                    collection of themes. This daring collection approaches sensitive themes such as sexual abuse in
                    the home, access to clean water and much more; with the purpose of breaking taboos and bringing
                    an awareness during this time where children are more vulnerable. This educational initiative
                    will be delivered to children across Africa through the distribution of visually stunning &
                    story-driven animation on the variety of themes and distributed through a variety of platforms.
                    We believe you will agree with us that this is an important cause in providing education to
                    children during this unprecedented time and will create an impact of change at grassroots level
                    and as an educational response to COVID-19.
